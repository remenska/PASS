This repository contains monitors generated for some examples of mu-calculus formulas. Note that the names of the processes are human-readable on purpose (in quotations), to aid in understanding how the transformation rules are applied. As such, mCRL2 will not directly accept these models for linearization.

In practise, in PASS the process names are encoded such that the models can be linearized directly.
